# Residue Number Systems in C++

A small example of arithmetic using Residue Number Systems.

Supported arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and modulo.

All relevant overloadable operators are properly overloaded.

Currently, the max number representable is 9576643908269.

This is due to the chosen number system found in ```rns.cpp```.

Other number systems can be chosen, but the arithmetic must check out.
